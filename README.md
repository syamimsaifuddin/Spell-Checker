# Spell-Checker

### Basic Spell checker using Tkinter GUI

To use - download both file .py and .txt and store in the same folder and run.

This is not an autocorrect. This program is to find mistakes in a text and suggest few candidates to replace the word.

Bigram and Edit Distance were involved to come up with word candidates for the error found in the spelling.

Feel free to clean the corpus to provide better dictionary for the program.
